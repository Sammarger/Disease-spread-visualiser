# Visual Spread of Disease NEA - Samuel Margerison 21/05/2021


## {1} Analysis 


### {1.1}   Introduction & Problem Background   

In recent years, worldwide pandemics have had lasting effects on the way we look at disease, making people fear for their lives and their loved ones. For example, many people became in tune with hygiene and disease prevention due to the worldwide spread of Coronavirus that has permanently changed the way we live and view disease as a whole. This fear epidemic has been magnified by the increasing number of fake and unreliable news sources using flashy figures and exaggerated headlines in order to hook users, amplifying public fears.

This project will be based around tracking and monitoring the spread of disease as accurately as possible and visualising the spread so that anyone can understand. The user should be able to access a wide range of information about COVID disease world-wide and locally. Data will be retrieved via a web scraping algorithm which will then be sent into a database in order to be visualised using graphs and world maps. This software aims to be as realistic as possible and doesnâ€™t have the intent of exploiting its users by using hyperbolic data and misleading language.

My project also aims to inform the user on whether they may have been in contact with someone who, or have themselves, are likely to have been infected by allowing users to keep updated with current symptoms and other users current symptoms. 

The main target audience for this project is a wide range of people that want to be informed on the subject but are not data experts. My specific client currently works for the NHS as a graphic designer and believes  that the understanding of data in a visual form is just as important as the data itself.


### {1.2}   Research		

For this project I aim to research in a variety of different ways in order to make the model up to my clients standards. Firstly, I will conduct a survey to see what my friends and family found intuitive and what they found impractical about existing data visualisers. I will also conduct my own research on popular disease trackers, identifying what worked and what could be improved. I will then test said programs against mine to see where improvements could be made.

Furthermore, I will research well made computer algorithms that perform web scraping, allowing my program to gather data for various websites across the globe and store said data within a database. Research on how to properly implement this database on graphs and visual aids may also need to occur.


### {1.3.1}	Client Overview

My client for this project is my dad, Paul Margerison, who is currently working as a graphic designer for the NHS, and has been working as a graphical designer all of his life. He believes that good and bad data representation can have a major impact on a user's perception of the news as a whole.

For this project, I have prepared a variety of questions related to the exact purpose and look of the program. Since the program is for a specific client, it is extremely important for the developer to maintain contact with the client throughout the production process so they are satisfied with the result.


### {1.3.2}   Interview


1. **What kind of information would you like to find within my program?** Statistical and numerical data would be more interesting and important as descriptive data is already easily accessible.
2. **Would you like there to be a login system?** Yes I would like a login system however if my username and passwords are insecure I would prefer not.
3. **Should the program focus on a specific country?** I would prefer if the program gave an overview of the world as a whole, while still making the data easily readable.

    **(d) What data about the disease would you like to have on this program?** As mentioned before, an overview of all the key statistics such as death-count, total number of cases, and potentially how these rates change over time.


**(e) Would you like to see a map of your local area?** A local map of London may be useful, especially if it is done in real time.

**(f) Are there any more features you would like to see?** If you were able to add your symptoms, contributing to a map of London, it would be interesting to see what counties are infected.


### {1.3.3}   Questionnaire

I asked my dad to conduct a quick survey with a few of his co-workers, who are also graphic designers working on the NHS website and its usability, in order to flesh out the design of the data visualiser. The results of the 17 surveys are as follows:



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


Though I previously asked Paul how I should represent the figures, I still believe that another opinion is needed, but the survey yielded the same results: nobody picked a table and the majority picked a world map.



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


This result was also expected, however for the sake of my client I will incorporate both suggestions into the project. Using a drop down menu, I will be able to have the program display a lot of data but separate it so each infographic is readable.



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


A login system is the easiest way to keep data secure, while still giving incumbent or new users access to the application. This also allows the program to keep track of the current user's infection status, as well as letting other users know who is infected also.



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")


Though only a small majority of users have requested a symptoms checker, I believe it is important for users to be able to keep track of when they were likely to have been infected, as well as who they have come into contact with. 



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image5.png "image_tooltip")


For this local map I will use information from the COVID symptoms checker:

each user can input the postcode they are currently in, and depending on whether they are likely to have covid, it is then added to a map of london, producing a secondary local map


### **{1.3.4}  Interview and Questionnaire Summary **

**Front End - **Both my client and survey results are clear that the design of the web page itself should be simplistic and should lack unneeded and unwanted information. Furthermore, I have understood that the displayed information should be separated into different pages altogether, and should only be seen one at a time, hence the explicit request of a drop down menu.

**Back End **-For the backends overall design structure I will be making use of a python web framework, allowing the project to be accessed on a local server. Furthermore,  As well as this, I will use web scraping algorithms in order to retrieve data off the web, SQL Database migration automation, and java to produce a graphic data map. 


## **{1.4}   Objectives**



1. **Login System**
    1. When a user enters the correct details they will be sent to the main menu.
    2. Simple registration page allowing new users to register.
    3. Each user should have a unique ID with an appropriately sized password.
    4. If a user enters incorrect information, the system will provide an error message.
    5. Passwords stored in a database secured by a hashing algorithm
    6. When a user enters the correct details the program should assign the username to any information they update the site with.
    7. User should be able to logout at any time using the logout button.
2. **Overall Website**
    8. Website should be organised into multiple pages, each with different uses.
    9. Each page should have a functioning header.
    10. Each page should include a sidebar directing users to different pages within the website.
3. **Menu Page**
    11. Page will connect to the symptoms database.
    12. Page should display all user symptoms updates from newest to oldest.
    13. Each post should contain the author, the date posted and symptom details such as current temperature and contact with the infected.
4. **Update Symptoms Page**
    14. Users should be prompted with a short questionnaire, providing the database with information such as loss of senses, current temperature and other covid-related symptoms.
    15. When user presses the submit button, the application will return the user to the main menu
    16. When the user submits symptoms, new post should be displayed on the main menu with the current date automatically set.
    17. When the user submits symptoms, the database should be updated with this new information
5. **Web Scraping Algorithm**
    18. When the user enters the COVID Data map page, the web scraping algorithm should begin
    19. Algorithm should strip the webpage of irrelevant information, leaving only data such as country,total cases, total deaths, active cases and total recovered.
    20. Information should be placed in a csv file in the correct order.
    21. SQL query should automatically migrate CSV file into database, updating any previous records
6. **World Data Map**
    22. Database should match JSON file countries so data fits corresponding countries
    23. JSON containing vector data for world map should produce a simple world map outline.
    24. Data within DB should be statistically coded to follow a colour spectrum on the sidebar
    25. Each country should be filled with its corresponding choropleth colour
    26. When countries are hovered over, the countries corresponding data should be displayed
    27. Seperate page with table showing the raw data for each country should be linked
7. **Local Data Map**
    28. An algorithm should sort through all user symptom cases and identify which ones are likely to be covid related.
    29. A record of all cases of user covid cases should be added to a database table.
    30. New dictionary should be created using the list of user input cases and their matching postcodes.
    31. Algorithms should match user case postcodes to postcodes on a JSON vector map. 
    32. Choropleth vector map should be created, with colours corresponding to the number of cases
    33. Colour key that should updates colours corresponding to the highest number of cases

### {1.4.2}    System Limitations


    As I am under time pressure and am constrained by my programming skill level, various features may be left out in order to perfect the main program objectives.


    If the user is offline, they will be unable to refresh the database and will be viewing outdated data, which is the data the user last saw when online or the original data if the user has never used the program.


## {1.5} 			Existing Systems


### {1.5.1}			CDC COVID Data Tracker

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view) 

The data visualiser used by CDC  uses a drop down menu allowing the user to pick and choose what data is being displayed.  For instance in this capture, deaths are mapped and visualised by the darkness of the shading, and the colours corresponding to the data are clearly displayed. 

This way of displaying data is simple to understand as there is no need to read text about the data, only figures corresponding to the colour.

CDCâ€™s data visualisation has a number of problems that could be improved, for instance, this data canâ€™t be accessed offline as it is on a website connected to the internet. As well as this, the diagram only shows the United States data, and though this website is centred around tracking COVID-19 across the United States, it is still an aspect that could be improved.


### {1.5.2}		Infectious Diseases Hub

[https://www.id-hub.com/disease-tracker/?disease=Zika](https://www.id-hub.com/disease-tracker/?disease=Zika) 

Infectious diseases hub collects data from various health institutes around the world and displays the location of where the data was found using a pinpoint on a world map. There is a drop down menu allowing you to view a plethora of different diseases, as well as a small description of each one. Each pinpoint, when clicked, gives a brief statement from the health institute about the current

There are many immediate issues seen with this disease tracker that have simple solutions that I will implement into my tracker. Firstly, the Legend widget does not correspond to the map as there are no green, red or orange areas shaded on the map, rendering the widget useless. Secondly, this map was swiped from google maps and the website needs internet access to open. Finally, above the zoom in/out widget, there is a white square that has no use, making the website seem less professional and less pleasing in a graphical design sense.


## {1.6} 		Solutions 


### {1.6.1}		Frameworks

For this project I will be using a variety of different coding languages in order to meet my clients requirements. Before starting this project, I had already predetermined what languages I wanted to use based on my prior skill level and aspects I knew would be implemented into a data visualisation project such as this.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td> LANGUAGE
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> Python
   </td>
   <td>Python is a simple and extremely flexible programming language that allows me to use a variety of tools such as django, flask and other tools to create server oriented programs. It must also be mentioned that I am most comfortable writing in python, so it is a clear choice using python as my main language for this project
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> SQL
   </td>
   <td>SQL is a necessity for any project that is uses a database, which is why I will definitely uses this frequently as my program requires constant database updates.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>HTML
   </td>
   <td>In order to produce functioning and visually appealing web pages I must use HTML to produce a working front-end
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Python Frameworks
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>GUI Packages
<p>
Framework
   </td>
   <td>GUI Packages are a widget oriented framework that allows the developer to produce an individual app. One main advantage of this is that when the user does not need access to a web page launcher which web frameworks do. Many packages such as TKinter have many tools within them that make producing infographics and interfaces simple and effective.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Web Frameworks
   </td>
   <td>Web frameworks do require access to a web page launcher however they do not require internet to run, all that is required is access to the computers ports, which is standard for any PC. As well as this  web frameworks often have pre built frameworks within them so the developer does not have to waste time starting from scratch. Furthermore, using different language algorithms within the project is much easier within these frameworks. 
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


I believe that using a web framework is ideal as I will be using a range of languages, not to mention that my client and I both have access to a web page launcher so the frameworks disadvantages are not a problem.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Python Web Frameworks
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Django
   </td>
   <td>Django is a free open-source full-stack python framework meaning it contains most of the necessary features by default when a new project is created. Django is especially useful as it uses ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to map objects to database tables, using a variety of databases such as postgreSQL and SQLite. This is particularly useful for my project as I will primarily be using SQLite.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Flask
   </td>
   <td>A python web framework that builds a solid web application foundation. Unlike Django, Flask is relatively lightweight and simple, making it much easier to pick up, not to mention that I have had some prior knowledge within Flask. 
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Though Flask may be simpler and take less time to fully understand, Djangoâ€™s database accessibility features are too useful to pass on and attempting to connect a database to Flask is an illogical waste of time, which is why I will be using Django for this project. 


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Geospatial Data Visualisation Library
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Folium
   </td>
   <td>Folium is a library built on Leaflet.js that enables users to create maps within python, rather than using java. Folium has the ability to create multi-layered complex maps, which I am unlikely to make use of as well as making folium potentially harder to learn and understand compared to other libraries.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Plotly / Plotly Express
   </td>
   <td>Plotly is a simple and intuitive data visualisation library with a high level application programming interface. Plotly also makes use of Dash, which may become useful as it gives the user the ability to deploy web apps.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


As data visualisation in python is a new concept to me and the map that I intend to create is fairly simple, I want an easy to learn library, which is why I will use Plotly for this project. As well as this, plotly has a lot of information on its website on how to create clean choropleth maps, which is what I will use to help me create my own.


### {1.6.2}		Finding Data Online 


    In order to visualise data, I need to collect the data using web scraping: Web scraping is a method of using various internet browsers to extract information.



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline drawings not supported directly from Docs. You may want to copy the inline drawing to a standalone drawing and export by reference. See <a href="https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html/wiki/Google-Drawings-by-reference">Google Drawings by reference</a> for details. The img URL below is a placeholder. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)


    A chosen scraping tool sends a request to a proxy server that creates a link to a target website. This target website either accepts or rejects the request given by the scraping tool and returns a response to the proxy server, which then relays the response back to the user.


### {1.6.3}	Existing Web Scraping Systems


    **ScrapingBee:**


    ScrapingBee is a complex web scraping API that has multiple uses including bulk web scraping, allowing the user to retrieve data from thousands if not millions of websites at once, making retrieving accurate information much easier. As well as this, ScrapingBee is able to identify keywords and check backlinks all at once. Finally the system is also used for the passive information gathering section of a  penetration test, in order to find social media pages, client details and more valuable information.


    ScrapingBee is a very complex system that has too many  functions that are not relevant for processes that I will be carrying out. For my project, I will only need a simple web scraping algorithm for very specific websites, meaning bulk scraping is not needed and neither is scraping bees other functions.  Furthermore, Scraping Bee is not free, meaning that if a user was to use my program, there would be a monthly fee that either I would have to pay or I would have to pay, which is not logical to pay if I am able to make an algorithm whose use is tailored specifically for my project.

**ParseHub:**


    Parse hub is a free, relatively simple and flexible web scraping program. Since it is a free package, it does not have as many features and scraping power as ScrapingBee does but similarly to ScrapingBee it does not require any coding knowledge. To reiterate, using Parse Hub contains the main problems that using any commercial web scraping program would. This program is not easily implemented into my code and it does not seem possible to automate the scraping process using a third party program.

**Conclusion:**


    These systems are however a good benchmark for how a web scraping algorithm should be produced: simply. Web scraping is about data abstraction and information hiding and my project should aim to break data down into the very least need to be understood and represented.


### {1.6.4}	Web Scraping Solutions

In order to properly web-scrape I will be using various modules including BeautifulSoup and Requests. The requests module is the scraping tool (as shown in the diagram) I will be using that allows me to send a request to a specific website and beautiful soup is able to identify patterns and words in the chosen website, and extract only key information needed.

The algorithm that extracts code will have to identify the key data specified, order  data into suitable rows and transfer them into a database.



<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert8">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


This image shows the source code for the html of a coronavirus live update chart, where beautiful soup will scan across the page in order to identify the id name of the table, _â€˜main_table_countries_todayâ€™_.


### {1.6.5}   Software Architecture


    For this project the software I will be using is Django, which uses a Model, View, Controller architecture. This is the most common architecture among developers as it is able to separate a program of any size into 3 different parts:


    

<p id="gdcalert8" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image7.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert9">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image7.png "image_tooltip")



    In this architecture the user will send a request to the controller, which acts as a link between user and server. The controller processes the request and calls the model, which contains all the data objects and acts as the backend to the whole application. Data is retrieved from the model and  the controller sends this to the view. The view is what the user can currently see, and a response is given on the page. This architecture allows for the model to be modified at any time as it is not coupled with the controller or view, it is only called for.


    MVC is beneficial to use for my program for numerous reasons:



* Ease of modification
* Ability to produce multiple views
* Each section is interdependent, allowing for frequent changes within the model without disrupting the entire architecture
* Allows for java to be integrated to produce a feature rich web application.


# {2}	  			 Design


## {2.1}		System Design Plan

	

The overall system will be fairly simple at first glance as the complexities of the program occur within the implementation of each node within the system.

In order to make the user system simpler, I will implement a guest system to make program testing easier, however depending on my clients preferences, the final design will not have a guest setting.


### {2.1.2}   Django App Framework

Django comes with a standard framework structure that makes it very simple to handle HTTP requests all within python. This prevents me from wasting time on building a web framework so I can spend more time on my core objectives.



<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image8.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image8.png "image_tooltip")


The Django Framework uses python objects known as models to represent the data being used in the program. Data includes SQL tables within a database, which also allows SQL data to be easily interpreted and modified within python.

Each function within views receives HTTP requests and returns the appropriate response corresponding to its URL pattern in urls.py. The relationship between models and views allows views to access the data to satisfy requests.

As well returning the appropriate response to its URL pattern, each  view will also call its corresponding template if it has one it is associated with, such that the template is displayed when the HTTP response is made.


### {2.1.3}  Django App Hierarchy

My Django Project will be made up of two apps, each with their own set of models, views and url patterns, making it much in the long run to repair and maintain the project if something goes wrong. The project will be split into a front app and a user app, such that user related algorithms are contained separately, allowing me to fix problems with each individual app without affecting the whole system.



<p id="gdcalert10" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert11">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")


Django has a built-in admin page, allowing me to create, update and delete user accounts, as well as user posts. However, since I intend for this project to be self-sufficient, meaning only the user has the ability to create and edit their profile, I will be making use of this feature for setting up the project and using as little as possible from then on.


### {2.2.1}   Overall System Design

Each  top-down diagram displays the order in which tasks are performed, starting from the top, right and moving left. Tasks are performed differently below display as depending on where the user goes, corresponding tasks are done.



<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image10.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image10.png "image_tooltip")


This is a design of the overall structure of the website and the order in which tasks done by the program are organised. Each large section is colour coded and details can be viewed below


### {2.2.2}   Render Server

Before any algorithms in the initial program can be executed, the server must be created and booted up first. This includes backend, such as creating the application, involving Urls, Models and Views, and creating the front end, which constitutes producing html templates for each view.


### {2.2.3}   Login Page



<p id="gdcalert12" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert13">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")



### {2.2.4}   Menu & update Symptoms Page


### {2.2.5}   Data Table & Mapbox

**{2.3.1}		Top Down Diagram**



<p id="gdcalert13" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image12.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert14">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image12.png "image_tooltip")


For this project I decided to begin on the login page, and from there the user is able to access the register, main menu and maps from the sidebars.



<p id="gdcalert14" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image13.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert15">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image13.png "image_tooltip")


User does not have to be logged in to access the  menu, however the user will be unable to enter any symptoms if they attempt to, as shown when the  user is â€˜redirected to the main menuâ€™.


### {2.3.2}			Flowcharts

When a user submits their symptoms, an algorithm will review it and decide whether the symptoms indicate a likely case of covid. If the user has 2 or more symptoms, or if they have been in contact with someone has has tested positive, the record will be added to the covid_record database. A new record will be created using user id and postcode, allowing the record to be added to the local map.


### {2.4.1}	  Database Structure & Design

**Django Models:**

As mentioned above, django uses models to represent each table in the database, so all parameters are set within python. Models are added to a database when they are migrated. 


```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```


These lines are executed in the django terminal, which will create a new folder called migrations, containing a Migration class with the model inside. Each migration file looks similar to this:


```
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import migrations, models

### {2.4.2}		Data Dictionaries

These data dictionaries show the data types and relationships between data for each table in my database.

 

Date data type is assumed to be a string with specific validation. Passwords and usernames also have requirements such as special characters when being created in order to increase security, however I did not believe it was necessary to display this validation here.

Postcode has its own validation as it must be within the list of postcodes set, however the user is unable to input a different postcode than the drop down, so I did not show this validation.

Auth_user is a built in table, I feel it is necessary to display as it is used frequently within the project.

The diagram portrays the relationship between users, user symptoms, and covid records. A user may have many symptoms but a symptom status can only have one user, whereas there is a one to one relationship between user symptoms and covid records, as each symptom update counts as only one record. This in turn means that there is also a one to many relationship between Users and COVID 

Records.

As shown above, UserID is needed by both User Symptom and Covid Record tables in order for each set of values to be identified/ 


### {2.5.6}			SQL Statements

**One Time Table Creation (Only executed once):**

It must be mentioned that these tables were created within **Django Models**, so the sql is done automatically when migrations to the database are made.



1. **<code>CREATE TABLEÂ covid_statistics(</code></strong>
2. <code>id <strong>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,</strong></code>
3. <code>country TEXT,</code>
4. <code>total_cases INTEGER,</code>
5. <code>total_deaths INTEGER,</code>
6. <code>total_recovered INTEGER,</code>
7. <code>active_cases INTEGER)Â Â </code>

<strong>	</strong>



8. **<code>CREATE TABLEÂ front_usersymtpoms( </code></strong>
9. <code>symtpom_id <strong>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</strong>,</code>
10. <code>temperature REAL,</code>
11. <code>loss_of_senses BOOL,</code>
12. <code>continuous_cough BOOL,</code>
13. <code>infected_contact BOOL,</code>
14. <code>date_set DATE,</code>
15. <code>postcode TEXT,</code>
16. <code>user_id <strong>INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES</strong> auth_user(id))</code>

<strong>Pre-built Django user authentication table:</strong>



17. **<code>CREATE TABLE auth_user(</code></strong>
18. <code>id <strong>INTEGER PRIMARY KEY</strong>,</code>
19. <code>password TEXT,</code>
20. <code>last_login DATETIME,</code>
21. <code>is_superuser BOOL,</code>
22. <code>username TEXT,</code>
23. <code>last_name TEXT,</code>
24. <code>email TEXT,</code>
25. <code>is_staff BOOL,</code>
26. <code>is_active BOOL,</code>
27. <code>date_joined DATETIME)</code>

<strong>SQL Queries to Update Table with New Values: </strong>



28. **<code>INSERT OR REPLACE INTO covid_statistics(id, country, total_cases, total_deaths, total_recovered, active_cases) VALUES (?,?,?,?);</code></strong>
29. <strong><code>INSERT INTO front_user_covid_record(user_id, covid_record_date_id, covid_record_postcode_id) SELECT user_id_id, date_set, postcode  FROM front_usersymptoms WHERE user_id_id=('" + str(user_id) +"');"</code></strong>

<strong>SQL Queries calling all data values from tables: </strong>



30. **<code>SELECT * FROM front_usersymptoms;</code></strong>
31. <strong><code>SELECT * FROM front_user_covid_record;</code></strong>


### {2.6.1}		Data Migration Plan

Using sqlite, my project will migrate the CSV file onto an existing database.

A problem that I may encounter in this program is that this will not just be carried out once but every time a user logs in.  Usually, a database is set up once and occasionally tweaked using the SQL terminal, however my program requires constant updates, and it is not logical for me to have to manually enter each line via the terminal everytime the program is loaded up. This means  that I must automate the CSV to DB migration process using an SQL algorithm. 


### {2.7.1}	Class Design

**_Model Classes_**

Each table within the database is represented as a class in models.py. Each model has attributes representing a table's data items. All rules for each data item are specified within the model classes.




<p id="gdcalert21" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image20.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert22">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image20.png "image_tooltip")


For the sake of simplicity, I have mentioned that attributes User_id, Postcode and Date_Set are public as they are both shared by user_covid_record and use symptoms under different names.

Usersymptom_form is inheriting from Usersymptoms:



<p id="gdcalert22" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image21.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert23">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image21.png "image_tooltip")


UserRegisterForm is inheriting from User, which is a table built in to the django framework, so its model does not need to be created:



<p id="gdcalert23" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image22.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert24">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image22.png "image_tooltip")


**_Django ListView and CreateView Classes_**

These specific views are class objects as they need the ability to display/create multiple instances of a table in a database.

Both classes inherit from Usersymptoms Model, whereas SymptomsCreateView also inherits from usersymptom_form:



<p id="gdcalert24" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image23.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert25">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

### {2.8.1}   Interface Design

As my project is a web application, I will be using a menu driven interface system, which is especially suited as the programs multiple usages need to be clearly defined, and therefore should be separated. 

**{2.8.1.2}  Login Page**

This will be the first thing the user sees when the link is clicked. It is advised for the user to login, however they still have the ability to use some features without signing in using the sidebar options. Top bar also contains a login button, which if pressed now would simply refresh the page. Design of the other pages will follow this very simple, formal structure.

When signing up a user must enter a valid username and password as well as confirming the password, preventing  the user from mistyping. User also has an option to enter email, which may be helpful if the project is expanded and a user needs assistance retrieving their data.


### {2.9.1}	  Data Security

Django has a built in hashing algorithm for passwords which is not accessible to anyone, even the developer of the project, increasing the users data security.


### {2.9.2}   Key Test Plan

In order to make sure my project will work accordingly, I must run a variety of tests. These tests must first of all prove all  core objectives have been met, as well as attempt to break the boundaries and understand the limitations of my project.

### {3.2.10}  External Files (not self written)

Both json files are simply vector images with name values assigned to each vector shape of each country/ district. I used this rather than creating my own as it would have been a waste of time since it already exists. As files are very large, I have taken the first value in each file, all other values within the list follow a similar structure.

For this map I did not think it was necessary to add a raw data table values are not extremely large and the number of districts is smaller than the number of countries, so users wonâ€™t be too overwhelmed when understanding the local map.

I am able to view my database tables using sqliteonline.com, and here I will provide screenshots of column names, as well as the first few lines of each table with data I have provided. All tables are from the sqlite.db database:

This table shows two symptom posts in which values can be stored on the map as the postcode selected is not within range. In order to prevent this I provided a dropdown menu, which was not in place before finalising the project.

# {4}  Testing


## {4.1} Testing Plan

In order to understand what works and what could be improved, I must run various tests. These tests will involve checking whether the main objectives I set out before starting the technical solution have been met. As well as this, I will be attempting to break the system in order to find its limitations.

The different areas of testing will include interface testing, structural testing, which involves testing every logical route in each module of code, and end user testing, where my client will use the project as feedback with any problems and improvements that could be made. In order to not waste time, some of my tests are able to show that more than one objective has been achieved, so I will only do the test once.


## {4.2} Testing Tables

All evidence of testing will be provided in the video below testing tables, and any evidence that can be screenshotted will be provided below the associated table

## {5.2} Client Evaluation

I asked my client, Paul Margerison, to use my program, giving me feedback on what he liked and what could be improved for future reference:

**_Login System_**

My client found logging in and registering simple and intuitive. He was able to easily understand where to go to register and where to input his information. On the other hand, he couldnâ€™t understand what was wrong when he input an invalid password due to the lack of an error message, which is something I must fix in future. As well as this, he felt slightly confused after submitting his username password as the main menu was blank, which is another issue which occurred.

**_Overall System_**

My client had no issues with the overall system as he found it very easily to navigate through the website, especially as all pages were accessible through the tagged sidebar.

**_Menu Page_**

My client believed this page was interesting, however he retracted his previous request to be able to view all user symptom posts, as he thought it may be an invasion of privacy. Other than this, he appreciated being able to see his own previous symptoms and their dates.

**_Update Symptoms Page_**

My client had a clear understanding of what the page was asking of him, and had no issues with inputting his information. He also appreciated the fact that the submit button is highlighted when hovered over as it made it clear where he was on the page.

**_World Data Map_**

My client was very pleased with the data map, finding the contrasting colours very easy to understand, as well as finding the data about each country interesting. Furthermore, he was also pleased with how the data table looks.

**_Local Data map_**

Similar to the global data map, my client was impressed with the local datamap and was surprised at how his symptom updates instantly enter the database and local map. In spite of this, he believed the colours on the colour key should be a scale of different colours rather than a gradient, however I must disagree as I aim to prove that this project has the ability to be used on a much larger scale, where a gradient is much more understandable than a scale of select colours when using large numbers. My client also believed that the hover over county feature should include the full name of the country, rather than just its postcode.


## {5.3}  Possible Improvements 

Taking into account my clients feedback, I think spending more time on small design changes is necessary for the user to understand, for instance, what is wrong with their password, so an error message should be produced. For the update symptoms page, I believe that the dropdown menu has too many options, which is why I would replace this with a regular expression algorithm which still prevents the user from entering an invalid postcode. 

For the world data map, in order to have more accurate information, I would produce a web scraping algorithm that takes covid information from multiple websites and produces an average as currently, using one source may be out of date/false. Moreover, rather than updating the information everytime the page is refreshed, I would like to introduce time scheduling that updates the covid map every minute. As well as this, I would introduce multiple versions of the choropleth maps with different colour keys for other data values such as total deaths, total recovered and active cases. This may be possible through the use of dash and plotly, however this would take too much time which is why it was not originally introduced. 

Though the local map contains data that is small, I believe that it is necessary to introduce a table page similar to the global COVID map page for users to be able to more clearly understand the data if ,theoretically ,the page is used on a larger scale. As well as this, adding the name of each county to the hover data is something I should add in future as it will make the map much more understandable.


## {5.4} Closing Statement

To refer back to the original issue, the use of a single trusted source for having understanding of what is occurring within your county could be achieved with a more developed version of this project.

I believe that this project has the potential to be used on a national scale and be a useful tool for the NHS and the general public for being able to understand how COVID has spread across the UK. I also think that the project can flexibly expand through increasing the size of the local map to a UK wide map.
